Python script that looks for available vaccination appointments in Greece
for the COVID-19 virus.

The script will most likely not work as-is, because the platform implemented
[rate limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting) that log you out
of the system after I tested the script against every single vaccination
center in Greece four times.

The script has not been tested thoroughly and some logical errors exist. It
was authored in bulk as a way to simplify the process of me looking for
vaccination appointments without losing too much time looking through different
vaccination centers in different postal codes, as I am currently under the
pressure of studying for my entry exams.

Please note that this script is not supposed to and **will not** book appointments
for you. Do not submit or publicize a patch that will allow for something like
this, as I strongly believe that doing so would be crossing ethical barriers.

## Requirements

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
- [An AMKA number](http://www.amka.gr/index_en.html)

Uninsured individuals, EU nationals and foreigners can obtain a temporary AMKA number
from any Citizen Service Centre (KEP).

## Instructions

- Login to [emvolio.gov.gr](https://emvolio.gov.gr) using your browser of choice.
- In Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, hit `F12` to open the web developer
console.
- Open the `Network` tab, refresh the page and click on a random network request.
Copy the values of the `Authorization` header and the `personId` header and paste
them in `config.py`.
- Change the values of the `day` and the `month` variable. The script, by default,
will look for appointments ranging from June 29th, 2021, all the way up to June
31st, 2021.

To prevent abuse, the script will use `tkAttiki.csv` by default, which will limit
results, if any, to the administrative region of Attica. You're strongly advised
to create a new `.csv` file with all of your desired vaccination centers in your
proximity and modify `emvolia.py` accordingly in order to use it.
